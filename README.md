# Credit-Card-Checker
This is a credit card checker that checks if a credit card is valid thru using an algorithm called the Luhn Algorithm. 
This credit card checker also checks multiple credit cards at once and puts invalid ones in a new array. This information
is then used in another function which checks what company the invalid card is linked with and saves an array of what 
companies to inform.
